    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Manually adapting icons is cumbersome, but icon pack authors who do not use this tool are more painful. They usually maintain a list of thousands of lines of adaptation items. In order to further reduce the cost of making icon packs, you can use the lightning adaptation function to quickly add adaptation items and matching icons.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Now open the icon list page, at this time there are few icons in list. Click the lightning-adapt button in the upper right corner and select "Auto adapt", as shown in the figure below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img" src="./imgEn/page2/preview_auto_button.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">After clicking Confirm, wait a moment, all your applications will be displayed in the list, as shown below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page2/preiew_icon_list_no_icon.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">At this time, you just added an adaptation to your installed application, and did not select an icon, so all icons are circular placeholders.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The power of this feature is that if you install some new applications, you can perform the "Auto adapt" operation again, and the tool will automatically complete the newly installed application information.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">If you do not have icon files named by package names extracted from the MIUI theme, the icon needs to be selected manually, because the tool does not know which icon file to use for each application. If you have icon files named by package names, you can further select "Auto match", as shown in the following figure:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img" src="./imgEn/page2/preview_auto_button2.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">After finding your folder of icon files, long press the folder and wait for a while, you will find that some icons have been automatically matched. The completion of matching depends on the degree of coverage of icon adaptation items by the icon files, as shown in the following figure:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page2/preiew_icon_list_auto_icon.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">For icons that cannot be automatically matched, you still need to manually select an icon. For items that do not have an icon, they are automatically ignored when exporting apk.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Next, you can export and test. Since this is not the first time to exporting, if you publish your icon pack in the application market, you need to modify the version information before updating, otherwise your users may not receive the update prompt. This is Android system version comparison mechanism determines.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Click the "Edit" button on the icon pack card and select "Version", you will see the following figure:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page2/preview_edit_pack_info.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Version Name will be displayed to the user, which can be any character; the Version Code must be a number, and it must be incremented when it is upgraded, otherwise the system will not think that this is a new installation package, if it is decremented, the system will indicate that the installation failed, and the downgrade installation must be uninstalled and reinstalled. The application adaptation email address here can be changed to your own, so that your users can send you an adaptation email on the application adaptation-request page.</p>
