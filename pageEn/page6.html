    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">This part of the tutorial is simple and easy compared to custom settings and the adaptation of dynamic icons.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">First of all, I want to emphasize the importance of <span style="font-weight: bold;">backup</span>. Since all icon pack project resources are stored locally, when you uninstall and reinstall the application, you will find that the entire application is new and will not save any data before uninstallation. Therefore, after each icon pack of your version is completed, it is best to save the icon pack project through the backup function. As long as there is a backup package exported by this application, you can restore the icon pack with one-click and continue editing.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The process of backup and import is automatic, as shown in the following figure:</p>
    <div class="text-center">

    </div>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page6/preview_restore.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The backup package is best stored in the network disk or computer, so as to avoid the problem of the mobile phone and the need to clear the data and lose it.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">So how to quickly make the second icon pack? It's actually really easy. Back up the first set of icon packs, and then import the backup file. At this time, you will get two identical icon pack projects. Modify the information of one of the icon packs to be new, this is your second set of icon packs. Next, you can replace the old icons one by one, or use the lightning adaptation function to select a new set of icons. The dynamic icons and custom settings can be modified as needed, which saves the tedious steps of adding adaptation items.</p>
