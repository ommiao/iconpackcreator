<div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">When you open the app at the first time, there is no icon pack, as shown in the following figure:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_main_empty.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">All the pictures used by this tool are in <font color="red">.png</font> format, no matter the icon or wallpaper file, please be sure to prepare the .png format files, otherwise you will not be able to find your picture in the file list.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Click the New button in the lower left corner to jump to the new icon pack page. Click on the logo at the top and select an icon. This icon will be the launcher icon for the exported apk; then input the basic information of the icon package, and the icon package name will be the application name for the exported apk. After editing, as shown below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_new_pack.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Click Save and the new icon pack project is created, as shown in the following figure:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_main_new.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Since this is the first time to make an icon pack, we will only add one icon as a demonstration. Click on the blank space above the icon pack card to enter the icon list page of the icon pack. At this time, the list is empty, click the add button at the bottom, and then input the name "phone" and click the icon to select an icon for the phone, as shown below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_icon_new.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Click Save, and an icon will be added to the list. As shown below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_icon_list.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">At this time, only the icon file is selected. We still need to continue to add adaptation items to this icon. Click the adaptation button, then click Add, and then select Import. You will see the information of all applications in the phone. Click "Phone" and the phone information is automatically filled in the input box, as shown below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_icon_adapt_edit.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Click Save, an adaptation item of "Phone" is completed, as shown below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_icon_adapt_list.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">You can add a lot of adaptation items here, because the "phone" information of each mobile phone brand may be different. If you want your icon pack to be perfectly adapted on other mobile phones, you need to count all information of "Phone", and add adaptation items one by one here.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Return to the application home page, you will find that the "phone" icon has been displayed on the icon pack card (the first 8 icons added will be displayed on the card), and the number of icons has also become "1 icons", as shown in the figure below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_main_icon.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">At this point, click the "Apk" button, the tool will automatically export .apk file, after successful exporting, the path of .apk file will be displayed at the bottom, as shown in the following figure:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page1/preview_task_apk.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Find the .apk file according to the path to the file management, and then install it on the phone, then open the launcher settings and select the newly installed icon pack. If nothing happens, the phone icon will become the icon selected in the icon pack. Currently supported launchers are Oneplus Launcher, Nokia Launcher, and mainstream third-party launchers such as Lawnchair, Apex, Poco, Microsoft etc.</p>
