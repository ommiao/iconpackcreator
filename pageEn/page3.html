<div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">First, we click the "Edit" button on the icon pack card and then select "Custom" to open the following page:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page3/preview_custom_list.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Next, I will explain the setting items one by one.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Main title: </span>The headline of the homepage of the icon pack after exporting, as shown below:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./img/page3/preview_main_title.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Black theme: </span>After opening, it will switch to a dark theme. Some icon styles may be more compatible with the black interface. You can choose according to your personal needs.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adapt self: </span>Open by default, if your icon pack is an irregular icon and a mask is set, please be sure to turn on this option, otherwise the logo of your icon pack apk may also be processed by the mask and cause a bad display effect. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto category: </span>Some launchers support separate icon replacement. All icons of icon pack will be listed when they are replaced separately. If there is no classification, it is very inconvenient to search for icons. After this option is turned on, it will be automatically classified according to the first letter of icon name. The effect of the icon package exported after classification on the Lawnchair launcher is as follows:</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./img/page3/preview_custom_classify.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wallpapers: </span>You can set up max five wallpapers, the first wallpaper will be displayed as a background on the icon pack card. The icon pack card is now similar to the actual effect of the icon pack for launcher. This is also the original intention of the homepage UI design. What you see is what you get, wallpaper background, and two rows of icons, as shown in the following figure:</p>

    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="preview-img preview-img-small" src="./imgEn/page3/preview_main_wallpaper.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Directory background: </span>Just select a folder background image, currently it may only be applicable to Oneplus launcher.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The following mainly explains the custom page. This page is left to the icon pack author to introduce his own icon pack. You can make an introduction to your icon pack style, or put a link to add your icon pack group, and you can even write an update log here.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The custom page is a simple static web page. The web page is selected because the web page is a universal text format, supports a strong style definition, and supports diverse elements such as pictures and links. This tutorial does not introduce the knowledge of web development, only provides sample code of two simple custom pages.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">There is a very important detail here. Please pay attention to it. When choosing a custom page, please put all related resources in the same folder, including but not limited to pictures, CSS style sheets, subfolders, etc. Please use relative path to access resources in the index.html file. The same level directory of the index.html file <font color="red">cannot contain</font> any unrelated files, otherwise they will be copied to the icon pack project.</p>
